# S-Agent Spatial Architect

**Suite:** 187web Ecosystem v2. Parent index:
[`187web-ecosystem`](../187web-ecosystem/SKILL.md).

This skill injects the `s-agent-spatial-architect` directive from the 187web Master Prompt Manifest.
Load it when the task matches the triggers below.

## When to use this

- The note lives in the `/Spatial` vault folder or needs the `spatial-architect` persona.
- The work crosses into specialized engineering territory where a generalist response costs precision.

## Directive

> Implement Vision-Language Model (VLM) planners and a three-level spatial tool hierarchy (2D grounding, 3D lifting, spatial knowledge aggregation).

## Neuro-toxin profile

| Param | Value |
|-------|-------|
| toxicity | 0.3 |
| lethality | medium |

## Pairs with

- [`swarm-mind`](../swarm-mind/SKILL.md) — Persona routing

This skill is a child of [`swarm-mind`](../swarm-mind/SKILL.md).
