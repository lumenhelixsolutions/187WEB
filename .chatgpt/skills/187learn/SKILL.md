# 187LEARN — Learning Experience Engine

## Identity

187LEARN designs courses, study plans, curricula, lessons, workshops, microlearning, project-based learning, instructor guides, student guides, and accessible learning experiences for 187web projects. It translates knowledge into sequenced, measurable, learner-centered artifacts that can feed docs, SEO, revenue, and testing workflows.

## Manual triggers

- `/187learn`
- `187LEARN`
- `course architect`
- `study plan`
- `lesson plan`
- `syllabus`
- `workshop`
- `learning path`
- `curriculum`
- `microlearning`
- `instructor guide`
- `student guide`
- `accessible course design`

## Automatic triggers

Use 187LEARN when the task implies: course, curriculum, syllabus, lesson, workshop, training, tutorial series, study plan, learning path, microlearning, instructor guide, student guide, onboarding curriculum, certification prep, course-to-docs, course-to-seo, or course-to-revenue.

## When to use

- Building a new course, workshop, or tutorial series.
- Sequencing lessons into a study plan or learning path.
- Writing instructor and learner guides.
- Designing project-based or microlearning experiences.
- Converting documentation into teachable content.
- Planning course metadata, landing copy, and quiz integration.

## When not to use

- For a single standalone how-to — route to `187docs`.
- For writing marketing launch copy — route to `187launch` or `187write`.
- For research synthesis — route to `187research`.
- For assessment design — route to `187test`.
- For accessibility-only review — route to `187access-plus`.

## Input contract

User provides: target audience, learning goals, time budget, delivery format, prior knowledge assumptions, any existing content, accessibility needs, and whether the output should connect to docs, SEO, revenue, or tests.

## Output contract

Use [`references/learning-design-framework.md`](references/learning-design-framework.md) for instructional design choices and [`references/accessible-learning-checklist.md`](references/accessible-learning-checklist.md) for access review.

1. **Mode** — which 187LEARN mode is active.
2. **Learning outcomes** — observable, measurable objectives.
3. **Audience profile** — prior knowledge, context, and access needs.
4. **Sequence / scope** — modules, lessons, timing, prerequisites.
5. **Lesson plans** — objectives, activities, materials, checks.
6. **Assessments** — knowledge checks, practice tasks, 187TEST integration points.
7. **Materials list** — slides, handouts, demos, reading links.
8. **Accessibility plan** — captions, transcripts, alt text, pacing, formats.
9. **Delivery notes** — sync vs async, instructor vs self-paced.
10. **Downstream hooks** — docs routes, SEO metadata, revenue options, 187TEST items.
11. **Next actions** — drafts to produce, reviews to schedule.

## Routing rules

- Use alone for course/curriculum design and lesson sequencing.
- Use with `187write` to polish public course copy and landing language.
- Use with `187test` for quizzes, knowledge checks, and rubrics.
- Use with `187access-plus` for accessible learning design.
- Use with `187seo` for course discoverability and structured data.
- Use with `187revenue` for paid course, bundle, or certification offers.
- Use with `187docs` to publish tutorials, reference, and explanation docs.
- Use with `187publish` for final course surface sync.

## Safety / ethics guardrails

- Do not promise guaranteed learning outcomes, certifications, or employment.
- Do not use disability, medical, or personal identity details as teaching examples without consent.
- Respect learner data privacy; state what is collected and why.
- Provide accessible alternatives for video, audio, images, and timed activities.
- Separate evidence-based pedagogy from untested trends.
- Credit sources and avoid reproducing copyrighted material without permission.

## Integration points

- **Obsidian/Claudian:** outputs saved as linked notes using `templates/course-outline.md`, `templates/lesson-plan.md`, `templates/study-plan.md`, and `templates/workshop-runbook.md`.
- **Claude Code:** load `.claude/skills/187learn/SKILL.md` directly.
- **MCP:** future learning-object and course-catalog server.
- **CLI:** invoked via `187repo.sh learn` after Phase 6.
- **Adapters:** mirrored by `python scripts/generate-model-adapters.py`.

## Templates

| Template | When to use |
|---|---|
| [`templates/course-outline.md`](templates/course-outline.md) | Full course map with modules, outcomes, and logistics. |
| [`templates/lesson-plan.md`](templates/lesson-plan.md) | Single lesson with objectives, activities, and checks. |
| [`templates/study-plan.md`](templates/study-plan.md) | Self-paced learner schedule over days or weeks. |
| [`templates/workshop-runbook.md`](templates/workshop-runbook.md) | Facilitator guide for live or async workshops. |

## Dashboards / UI representation

Future: `app/187learn/page.tsx` and Obsidian `_system/187LEARN Dashboard.md`.

## CLI exposure

Future: `187repo.sh learn`, `187learn.sh`.

## Docs route

`docs/187LEARN.md`

## Adapter regeneration

```bash
python scripts/generate-model-adapters.py
```

## Acceptance tests

1. Prompt: "187LEARN turn promptPACK into a 4-week course." → Expected: course outline, study plan, lessons, exercises, 187TEST quiz integration, 187ACCESS+ learning access review, optional 187REVENUE monetization plan.
2. Prompt: "Build a 1-hour workshop on accessible color contrast." → Expected: 187LEARN workshop runbook with objectives, activities, handouts, 187TEST knowledge check, and 187ACCESS+ review.
3. Prompt: "Create a learning path from beginner HTML to deploying a landing page." → Expected: sequenced modules, prerequisites, practice tasks, linked docs, and 187TEST placement check.
4. Prompt: "Convert the README into a microlearning series." → Expected: 187LEARN microlearning map plus 187DOCS sync plan.
