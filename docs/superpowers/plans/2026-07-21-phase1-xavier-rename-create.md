# Phase 1 — Xavier Rename, Recolor, and 187CREATE Skill

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` or `superpowers:executing-plans` to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Rename the fifth agent from Krishna to Xavier, apply the new agent color map, add the `187CREATE` first-class skill, and rebalance Phase 1 skill assignments so the site stays green at every commit.

**Architecture:** Use existing `AgentPage`/`AgentDepartments` patterns. No new data layer yet — that comes in Phase 2. Keep changes mechanical and reviewable.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, static export for GitHub Pages.

## Task 1: Rename Krishna route and page to Xavier

**Files:**
- Rename: `app/krishna/page.tsx` → `app/xavier/page.tsx`
- Modify: `components/launch/XavierSkillChains.tsx` (created in Task 2)

### Step 1: Rename the directory

```bash
cd D:/projects/187WEB
git mv app/krishna app/xavier
```

### Step 2: Rewrite `app/xavier/page.tsx`

Replace the old Krishna content with the Xavier page:

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { AgentPage, type AgentConfig } from "@/components/launch/AgentPage";
import { XavierSkillChains } from "@/components/launch/XavierSkillChains";

const agent: AgentConfig = {
  slug: "xavier",
  name: "XAVIER",
  tagline: "Final creation + council",
  color: "#a855f7",
  skillIds: ["docs", "version", "publish", "launch", "natasha", "test"],
  overview:
    "XAVIER is the only male-coded agent on the crew. He owns final creation and production responsibility, cross-crew vision, and the council command. He can call huddles, interject across teams, and appeal to any 1st, 2nd, or 3rd class skill to ship the final artifact.",
};

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: `${agent.name} — 187WEB Agent`,
  description: agent.overview,
};

export default function XavierPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <AgentPage agent={agent} />
      <XavierSkillChains />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Remove stale Krishna route if empty

```bash
rmdir app/krishna 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 4: Verify route builds

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Expected: no errors.

### Step 5: Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(agents): rename Krishna route to Xavier"
```

---

## Task 2: Rename KrishnaSkillChains to XavierSkillChains

**Files:**
- Rename: `components/launch/KrishnaSkillChains.tsx` → `components/launch/XavierSkillChains.tsx`
- Modify: `components/launch/skillchains-data.ts`

### Step 1: Rename the file

```bash
cd D:/projects/187WEB
git mv components/launch/KrishnaSkillChains.tsx components/launch/XavierSkillChains.tsx
```

### Step 2: Update the component name and strings

In `components/launch/XavierSkillChains.tsx`, replace the function name and every Krishna reference:

```tsx
export function XavierSkillChains() {
```

Update the label line:

```tsx
<p className="text-xs font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.2em] text-[#a855f7]">
  XAVIER SkillChains
</p>
```

Update the description:

```tsx
<p className="mt-4 text-white/60">
  End-to-end combinations of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class skills that XAVIER
  can hold, run, and distribute. Each chain links to the skill pages that
  produce its artifact.
</p>
```

Replace every other `#3b82f6` color token in this file with `#a855f7` (six occurrences in borders, backgrounds, and text).

### Step 3: Update `components/launch/skillchains-data.ts`

No string literal changes are required in the data file, but ensure there are no remaining `Krishna` references. The chains stay neutral.

### Step 4: Lint and typecheck

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

Expected: clean.

### Step 5: Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor(agents): rename KrishnaSkillChains to XavierSkillChains and recolor purple"
```

---

## Task 3: Update AgentDepartments roster, colors, and overviews

**Files:**
- Modify: `components/launch/AgentDepartments.tsx`

### Step 1: Replace the top comment block

```tsx
/**
 * Top-level 187WEB agent ecosystem.
 *
 * Agent → skill mapping:
 * - NATASHA: natasha, chain, test (external / post-launch security + applications)
 * - YELENA: natasha, test, access-plus, include (pre-launch internal security + safety gates + applications)
 * - CHARLOTTE: repo, craft, vibe, launch, write, research (application orchestration)
 * - KALI: seo, revenue, publish, create, repo, vibe (growth + create assist)
 * - XAVIER: docs, version, publish, launch, natasha, test (final creation / production + council)
 *
 * NATASHA and YELENA split security duties so CHARLOTTE and KALI stay focused
 * on application work. Any agent can jump in, assign subagents, call any 1st/2nd/3rd
 * class skill when triggered, or appeal to XAVIER for a council or SkillChain.
 */
```

### Step 2: Replace the `AGENTS` array

```tsx
const AGENTS: AgentConfig[] = [

  },
  {
    slug: "charlotte",
    name: "CHARLOTTE",
    tagline: "Application orchestration",
    color: "#3b82f6",
    skillIds: ["repo", "craft", "vibe", "launch", "write", "research"],

    name: "KALI",
    tagline: "Growth + create assist",
    color: "#39FF14",
    skillIds: ["seo", "revenue", "publish", "create", "repo", "vibe"],

  },
  {
    slug: "xavier",
    name: "XAVIER",
    tagline: "Final creation + council",
    color: "#a855f7",
    skillIds: ["docs", "version", "publish", "launch", "natasha", "test"],
    overview:
      "XAVIER is the only male-coded agent and the crew's final creation / production lead. He sees across all crews, can call a council huddle or Q&A, and owns the publish/launch/version skills that turn work into shipped artifacts.",
  },
];
```

### Step 3: Update the section heading

```tsx
<h2 className="mt-4 text-[clamp(2rem,1.2rem+3vw,3.5rem)] font-bold tracking-tight text-white">
  Five agents. One web hive.
</h2>
```

### Step 4: Run lint/typecheck

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

### Step 5: Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(agents): recolor crew and rebalance Phase 1 skill assignments"

          "Generate three ad-creative variants for [channel] promoting [offer]. Each variant needs headline, hook, visual direction, and CTA.",
      },
    ],
  },
```

### Step 2: Add to `lib/first-class-skills.ts`

Insert after the `craft` object:

```ts
  { id: "create", name: "187CREATE", route: "create", docs: "187CREATE" },

```

---

## Task 6: Create 187CREATE public surface

**Files:**
- Create: `app/187create/page.tsx`
- Create: `docs/187CREATE.md`
- Create: `.claude/skills/187create/SKILL.md`

### Step 1: Create skill page

```bash
mkdir -p app/187create .claude/skills/187create
```

Write `app/187create/page.tsx`:

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import { SkillShowcase } from "@/components/showcase/SkillShowcase";
import { skillShowcaseIndex } from "@/lib/skill-showcase-data";

const skill = skillShowcaseIndex.get("create")!;

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: `${skill.name} — 187WEB Skill`,
  description: skill.description,
};

export default function CreateSkillPage() {
  return <SkillShowcase skill={skill} />;
}
```

### Step 2: Write `docs/187CREATE.md`

```markdown
# 187CREATE

**Identity:** Growth-first creation skill for landing pages, ad creatives, influencer kits, and conversion-focused surfaces.

**Class:** 1st class — public routed skill.

## Triggers

- "Create a landing page"
- "Spin up ad creative"
- "Design an influencer kit"
- "Optimize a conversion surface"
- "Build a growth MVP"

## When to use

Use 187CREATE when you need to ship a growth asset quickly without waiting for a full design-system pass. It pairs with 187CRAFT to systemize winners, 187PUBLISH for the release gate, and 187SEO/187REVENUE for traffic and monetization.

## Output contract

- Shipped growth page or component set
- Campaign brief with copy and asset checklist
- Conversion checklist and A/B candidate list
- Handoff notes for 187CRAFT / 187PUBLISH

## Templates

### Landing page MVP

Create a one-section landing page for [offer] targeting [audience]. Include headline, subhead, social proof placeholder, CTA, and accessibility checks.

### Ad creative brief

Generate three ad-creative variants for [channel] promoting [offer]. Each variant needs headline, hook, visual direction, and CTA.

## Acceptance tests

- [ ] Output renders on mobile and desktop without horizontal scroll.
- [ ] CTA is above the fold and has a clear verb.
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA.
- [ ] Includes alt text for every image.
- [ ] Lists the next skill to call (usually 187PUBLISH or 187CRAFT).

## Routes

- Primary: `/187create`
- Systemize winner: `/187craft`
- Publish gate: `/187publish`
- SEO pass: `/187seo`
```

### Step 3: Write `.claude/skills/187create/SKILL.md`

```markdown
---
name: 187CREATE
description: Growth-first creation skill for landing pages, ad creatives, influencer kits, and conversion-focused surfaces.
origin: 187WEB skill suite
---

# 187CREATE

Build growth surfaces fast. 187CREATE is Kali's counterpart to Charlotte's 187CRAFT: it prioritizes speed and conversion over systemization.

## Responsibilities

- Landing page MVPs
- Ad creative variants and copy
- Influencer / partner asset kits
- Conversion optimization passes

## Handoffs

- Systemize a winner → 187CRAFT
- Release gate → 187PUBLISH
- Discoverability → 187SEO
- Monetization → 187REVENUE

## Templates

### Landing page MVP

Create a one-section landing page for [offer] targeting [audience]. Include headline, subhead, social proof placeholder, CTA, and accessibility checks.

### Ad creative brief

Generate three ad-creative variants for [channel] promoting [offer]. Each variant needs headline, hook, visual direction, and CTA.
