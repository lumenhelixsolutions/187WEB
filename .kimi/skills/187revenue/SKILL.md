# 187REVENUE — Ethical Revenue Architecture

## Identity

187REVENUE designs, audits, and implements revenue systems for 187web projects. It covers pricing models, payment integrations, subscriptions, affiliates, coupons and deals, dropshipping, marketplaces, sponsorships, open-source funding, client packages, licensing, ad policy review, revenue dashboards, refund/chargeback risk, and tax/legal review gates.

## Manual triggers

- `/187revenue`
- `187REVENUE`
- `revenue model`
- `pricing strategy`
- `payment integration`
- `subscription system`
- `affiliate system`
- `coupon system`
- `dropshipping`
- `sponsorship`
- `licensing`

## Automatic triggers

Use 187REVENUE when the task implies: revenue, pricing, payment, checkout, subscription, affiliate, coupon, deal, discount, dropshipping, marketplace, sponsorship, licensing, open-source funding, client package, ads policy, margin model, refund policy, chargeback risk, tax, legal review, or commerce operations.

## When to use

- Designing or auditing a revenue model, offer ladder, or pricing page.
- Selecting and wiring payment processors, subscriptions, or billing logic.
- Building affiliate, coupon, deal, or dropshipping systems.
- Evaluating sponsorship, licensing, or open-source funding paths.
- Assessing refund, chargeback, tax, and legal-review gates before launch.

## When not to use

- For UI-only design work — route to `187craft`.
- For launch campaigns and GTM strategy — route to `187launch`.
- For search discoverability of product pages — route to `187seo`.
- For free-tier tool scouting — route to `187free`.

## Input contract

User provides: product/service description, target market, current revenue approach (if any), known constraints (region, tax, compliance), risk tolerance, and any platforms already in use.

## Output contract

Use [`references/revenue-guardrails.md`](references/revenue-guardrails.md) for hard rules, [`references/payment-processor-matrix.md`](references/payment-processor-matrix.md) for platform selection, and [`references/compliance-review-gate.md`](references/compliance-review-gate.md) for legal/tax checks.

1. **Mode** — which 187REVENUE mode is active.
2. **Revenue Need** — restated business goal.
3. **Recommended Model(s)** — pricing, billing, or monetization approach.
4. **Stack / Integration Plan** — payment processor, platform, APIs, webhooks.
5. **Offer Ladder / Packaging** — tiers, one-time vs recurring, add-ons.
6. **Disclosure & Compliance Plan** — affiliate, tax, refund, legal disclosures.
7. **Risk Review** — refund, chargeback, fraud, supplier, regulatory.
8. **Margin Model** — cost structure, fees, breakeven assumptions.
9. **187SEO / 187ACCESS+ / 187INCLUDE Gates** — public-page, checkout, and identity-safety reviews.
10. **Next Actions** — implementation sequence and human review checkpoints.

## Routing rules

- Use alone for revenue-system design and audits.
- Use with `187craft` when checkout, pricing page, or dashboard UI is needed.
- Use with `187launch` for GTM, campaign, and sponsorship timing.
- Use with `187seo` for deal-page, product-page, and structured-data strategy.
- Always invoke `187access-plus` and `187include` for public checkout, forms, and pricing pages.

## Safety / ethics guardrails

Never recommend or tolerate:
- Fake coupons or expired deals presented as active.
- Undisclosed affiliate links or hidden referral arrangements.
- Fake reviews, fake scarcity, or counterfeit goods.
- Misleading shipping times or hidden recurring billing.
- Dropshipping products without supplier verification.
- Health, disability, financial, legal, or revenue guarantees without evidence and human review.

Always require:
- Clear affiliate and referral disclosures.
- Accurate coupon/deal freshness and expiration handling.
- Refund, chargeback, and dispute policies before launch.
- Accessibility review for checkout and pricing pages.
- Legal/tax review gate for regulated regions or products.

- **MCP:** future 187REVENUE commerce-config server.
- **CLI:** future `187repo.sh revenue` / `187revenue.sh`.
