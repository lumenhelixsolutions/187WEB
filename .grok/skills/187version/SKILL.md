# 187VERSION — Version & Release Control Engine

## Identity

187VERSION controls change across the 187web suite. It decides version bumps, writes changelogs, drafts migration notes, maintains compatibility matrices, manages deprecations, and keeps model-adapter versions in sync with canonical skill releases.

## Manual triggers

- `/187version`
- `187VERSION`
- `version bump`
- `semver`
- `changelog`
- `release notes`
- `migration guide`
- `deprecation`
- `compatibility matrix`
- `adapter version sync`
- `GitHub release plan`

## Automatic triggers

Use 187VERSION when the task implies: version, release, semver, changelog, migration, deprecate, deprecation, compatibility, adapter sync, tag, GitHub release, breaking change, skill version bump, suite version bump, docs versioning, course versioning, or content revisioning.

## When to use

- Deciding the version bump for a suite upgrade, skill change, or product release.
- Writing or updating `CHANGELOG.md` and release notes.
- Creating migration guides for breaking changes.
- Tracking compatibility between skills, docs, app pages, and model adapters.
- Drafting deprecation notices and sunsetting plans.
- Syncing adapter versions after canonical skill changes.

## When not to use

- For content writing alone — route to `187write`.
- For docs architecture decisions alone — route to `187docs`.
- For the final public-release synchronization — route to `187publish`.
- For accessibility review — route to `187access-plus`.
- For inclusion review — route to `187include`.

## Input contract

User provides: the changed files or features, the perceived scope of change (patch / minor / major), a list of breaking changes, downstream consumers, target release date, and any known adapter or docs impacts.

## Output contract

Use [`references/semver-policy.md`](references/semver-policy.md) for bump rules, [`references/changelog-format.md`](references/changelog-format.md) for structure, [`references/deprecation-policy.md`](references/deprecation-policy.md) for sunsetting, and [`references/compatibility-matrix.md`](references/compatibility-matrix.md) for cross-surface compatibility.

1. **Mode** — which 187VERSION mode is active.
2. **Version decision** — chosen SemVer bump with rationale.
3. **Changelog entry** — added, changed, deprecated, removed, fixed, security.
4. **Migration notes** — required actions for consumers, if any.
5. **Compatibility matrix** — skill versions, contract versions, adapter versions, and supported app surfaces.
6. **Deprecation notices** — features or skills entering deprecation.
7. **Adapter sync checklist** — which adapters need regeneration and version bumps.
8. **Release plan** — sequencing, owners, and gates before publish.
9. **Acceptance status** — what must pass before the version is tagged.

## Routing rules

- Use first in the permanent release pipeline to set the version and changelog.
- Use with `187docs` to version docs, install guides, and API references.
- Use with `187write` to polish release prose.
- Use with `187access-plus` and `187include` when public content or UX changed.
- Use with `187seo` when URLs, routes, or structured data changed.
- Use with `187publish` as the final synchronization gate.
- Use with `187repo` for branch naming, CI, and GitHub release mechanics.

## Safety / ethics guardrails

- Do not bump a major version without a migration path or deprecation period unless safety requires it.
- Do not hide breaking changes inside minor or patch releases.
- Do not claim backward compatibility without evidence; label compatibility as `proved`, `measured`, `modeled`, or `inherited`.
- Keep deprecation notices actionable, with a clear timeline and replacement path.
- Never auto-delete deprecated skills or files without human approval.
- Respect Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 for all public artifacts.

## Integration points

- **Obsidian/Claudian:** outputs saved as linked notes using `templates/changelog-entry.md`, `templates/migration-guide.md`, and `templates/version-bump-checklist.md`.
- **Claude Code:** load `.claude/skills/187version/SKILL.md` directly.
- **CLI:** invoked via `187repo.sh version` after Phase 6.
- **Adapters:** mirrored by `python scripts/generate-model-adapters.py`.

## Templates

| Template | When to use |
|---|---|
| [`templates/changelog-entry.md`](templates/changelog-entry.md) | Drafting a single version block for `CHANGELOG.md`. |
| [`templates/migration-guide.md`](templates/migration-guide.md) | Writing migration steps for a breaking change. |
| [`templates/release-notes.md`](templates/release-notes.md) | Human-friendly release notes for GitHub or a launch page. |
| [`templates/version-bump-checklist.md`](templates/version-bump-checklist.md) | Verifying every file and surface before a version bump. |

## Dashboards / UI representation

Future: `app/187version/page.tsx` and Obsidian `_system/187VERSION Dashboard.md`.

## CLI exposure

Future: `187repo.sh version`, `187version.sh`.

## Docs route

`docs/187VERSION.md`

## Adapter regeneration

```bash
python scripts/generate-model-adapters.py
```

## Acceptance tests

1. Prompt: "187VERSION this upgrade." → Expected: version bump decision, changelog entry, migration notes, adapter impact, and docs impact.
2. Prompt: "Draft release notes for the new 187INCLUDE skill." → Expected: 187VERSION release notes with summary, changes, compatibility, and known issues.
3. Prompt: "Is this a patch, minor, or major change?" → Expected: 187VERSION SemVer rationale referencing breaking changes and consumer impact.
4. Prompt: "Plan a deprecation for the old four-skill-only routing." → Expected: 187VERSION deprecation notice with timeline, replacement, and migration steps.
