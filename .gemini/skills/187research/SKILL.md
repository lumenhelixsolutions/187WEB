# 187RESEARCH — Research-Grade Lab Engine

**Suite:** 187web design ecosystem. Route research questions through scientific, mathematical, biomedical, software, and scholarly databases; classify claims; build reproducible lab artifacts; and convert findings into source-backed notes, demos, papers, specs, and product paths.

## Core definition

187RESEARCH is the Lumen Helix research-grade lab engine. It routes research questions through appropriate scientific, mathematical, biomedical, software, and scholarly databases; classifies claims; builds reproducible lab artifacts; generates professional and collegiate-quality interactive labs; and converts findings into source-backed notes, demos, papers, specs, and product paths.

187RESEARCH must support:

- source discovery
- source triage
- literature review
- citation graphing
- database/API routing
- computational notebooks
- browser labs
- mathematical proof-vs-pattern separation
- biomedical evidence discipline
- code/repository/package research
- FAIR data records
- reproducibility reports
- public-claim risk reviews
- publication/paper/spec drafting
- research-to-product conversion
- 187FREE integration for no-cost lab hosting and tooling

## Trigger phrases

- `/187research`
- `187RESEARCH`
- `research this`
- `source this`
- `build a lab`
- `make this reproducible`
- `literature review`
- `citation map`
- `claim audit`
- `proof vs pattern`
- `find papers`
- `find datasets`
- `database query`
- `bio database`
- `med database`
- `math database`
- `coding database`
- `professional lab`
- `college lab`
- `academic standard`
- `research dashboard`
- `publication ready`

## Automatic trigger contexts

Use 187RESEARCH when the task includes or implies:

- research, paper, source, citation
- dataset, database
- PubMed, PMC, NCBI, Europe PMC
- arXiv, Crossref, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar
- PubChem, UniProt, RCSB PDB, AlphaFold
- OEIS, LMFDB, DLMF
- proof, theorem, conjecture
- computation, simulation, reproducibility, experiment
- notebook, lab, visualization, model, benchmark
- evidence, peer-reviewed
- clinical, biomedical, mathematical
- coding research, repository analysis, package analysis

## Required output format

Every 187RESEARCH answer must follow this structure:

1. **Research Need** — What question or claim is being investigated.
2. **Domain Classification** — Scholarly, biomedical, mathematical, software/code, public data, or mixed.
3. **Best Source Routes** — Databases, APIs, registries, and repositories to query.
4. **Database / API Query Plan** — Concrete queries, identifiers, and search strategies.
5. **Evidence Ladder** — Classification of each claim using the 187RESEARCH claim ladder.
6. **Lab Artifact Plan** — Which research artifacts to produce, from source note through publication brief.
7. **Reproducibility Checklist** — Data, code, environment, seeds, provenance, and sharing steps.
8. **Citation / Source Lineage Plan** — How every claim will be traced to a citable source.
9. **Public-Claim Risk** — Risk level and required reviews before public release.
10. **187FREE Tooling / Hosting Options** — No-cost tools and hosting for the lab or demo.
11. **Next Actions** — Concrete, assignable next steps.

## Claim ladder

Classify every claim exactly once:

| Rung | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **proved** | Formal proof or rigorous derivation exists. |
| **measured** | Empirical measurement with documented method and uncertainty. |
| **modeled** | Result from an explicit model or simulation; model assumptions listed. |
| **inherited** | Taken from a cited source; trust depends on source quality. |
| **interpreted** | Reasonable inference from evidence; not direct proof or measurement. |
| **speculative** | Hypothesis or conjecture; explicitly flagged as such. |
| **poetic / metaphorical** | Aids intuition but must not be mistaken for evidence. |
| **unsupported** | No backing evidence; reject or downgrade before publication. |

## Research artifact ladder

Produce artifacts in ascending order of investment:

1. **source note** — One source, captured and cited.
2. **literature review** — Synthesis of multiple sources around a question.
3. **annotated bibliography** — Source list with relevance and quality notes.
4. **citation graph** — Visual or tabular map of cited works and relationships.
5. **dataset card** — FAIR metadata and provenance for a dataset.
6. **computational notebook** — Reproducible code, figures, and narrative.
7. **interactive lab** — Browser-based demo with parameters and exports.
8. **reproducibility report** — Full record of methods, environment, and verification.
9. **public research page** — Published summary for a general audience.
10. **paper draft** — Formal manuscript with sections and citations.
11. **product spec** — Research findings converted to buildable requirements.
12. **launch/demo page** — Public-facing demo with claim audit and 187FREE plan.

## 187FREE integration

187RESEARCH relies on 187FREE whenever a lab, demo, notebook, publication page, or research-to-product workflow needs no-cost tooling or hosting.

Use 187FREE inside 187RESEARCH for:

- free static hosting for public research pages
- free computational notebook platforms
- free database/storage for research demos
- free visualization libraries and dashboard tools
- free CI/CD for reproducible builds
- free accessibility checkers for public outputs
- free domain-like URLs and analytics for demos

Order when both apply:

1. 187RESEARCH defines the research/lab requirements.
2. 187FREE finds the lowest-cost/free implementation path.
3. Claim audit and privacy review run before publishing.
4. Git baseline commit before creating or modifying many files.

## Privacy and sensitivity rules

For medical, clinical, legal, civic, disability, client, invention, or private research projects:

- Prefer local-first or private-by-default tools.
- Avoid unnecessary third-party storage of raw data.
- Avoid hidden telemetry in lab shells and demos.
- Require explicit consent before sharing, tracking, or publishing.
- Add human-review gates before any public claim or clinical interpretation.
- Do not provide diagnosis or treatment guidance; create evidence summaries and flag for professional review.

## Slash commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/187research` | Activate this skill |
| `/187research <question>` | Begin a research workflow for a specific question |
| `/187research lab <topic>` | Draft a reproducible lab plan |
| `/187research audit <claim>` | Audit a claim against the evidence ladder |
