# 187PUBLISH — Release Synchronization Engine

## Identity

187PUBLISH is the final gate in the 187web release pipeline. It audits every public surface for drift, synchronizes docs, READMEs, command pages, install docs, model-adapter docs, skill indexes, app routes, GitHub Pages showcases, screenshots, and demos, and produces a go/no-go decision for the release.

## Manual triggers

- `/187publish`
- `187PUBLISH`
- `publish audit`
- `release sync`
- `docs drift`
- `showcase drift`
- `GitHub Pages sync`
- `README sync`
- `command page sync`
- `install doc update`
- `skill index update`
- `SEO publish check`
- `accessibility publish check`
- `inclusion publish check`

## Automatic triggers

Use 187PUBLISH when the task implies: publish, release sync, docs drift, showcase drift, GitHub Pages, product launch page, README sync, command page sync, install doc update, model adapter doc update, skill index update, screenshot demo plan, SEO publish check, accessibility publish check, inclusion publish check, or final release gate.

## When to use

- Before any public release or suite upgrade.
- When docs, app routes, adapters, README, or CHANGELOG may be out of sync.
- Preparing or updating the GitHub Pages product showcase or launch page.
- After 187VERSION, 187DOCS, 187WRITE, 187ACCESS+, 187INCLUDE, and 187SEO have run.

## When not to use

- For version decisions — route to `187version`.
- For writing content alone — route to `187write`.
- For accessibility audits — route to `187access-plus`.
- For inclusion reviews — route to `187include`.
- For SEO strategy — route to `187seo`.

## Input contract

User provides: the release scope, the target version, the list of changed skills/files, expected public surfaces, current CI status, and any known drift or exceptions.

## Output contract

Use [`references/publish-surface-registry.md`](references/publish-surface-registry.md) for the full surface list, [`references/release-checklist.md`](references/release-checklist.md) for gates, [`references/docs-drift-map.md`](references/docs-drift-map.md) for doc dependencies, and [`references/showcase-sync-matrix.md`](references/showcase-sync-matrix.md) for app and showcase alignment.

1. **Mode** — which 187PUBLISH mode is active.
2. **Surface inventory** — every public or internal surface that must be synchronized.
3. **Drift findings** — missing updates, stale references, or inconsistent claims.
4. **Sync actions** — concrete file changes and owners.
5. **Release checklist** — completed and pending gates.
6. **SEO publish check** — metadata, structured data, URLs, and crawlability status.
7. **Accessibility publish check** — WCAG-plus review status for public pages.
8. **Inclusion publish check** — identity-safe copy and form review status.
9. **GitHub Pages plan** — showcase updates, launch page, and asset plan.
10. **Final go/no-go** — release decision with blockers and follow-ups.

## Routing rules

- Run last in the permanent release pipeline after 187VERSION, 187DOCS, 187WRITE, 187ACCESS+, 187INCLUDE, and 187SEO.
- Use with `187repo` for CI status, branch rules, and GitHub release mechanics.
- Use with `187craft` for screenshots, demos, and visual assets.
- Use with `187launch` for launch-page copy and campaign alignment.
- Use with `187version` for tag and changelog verification.

## Safety / ethics guardrails

- Do not publish any public page, form, checkout, course, quiz, docs page, or showcase update without 187ACCESS+ and 187INCLUDE review.
- Do not publish public claims without an evidence label (`proved`, `measured`, `modeled`, `inherited`, `interpreted`, `speculative`, or `unsupported`).
- Do not bypass CI failures or lint/typecheck errors.
- Do not publish stale docs, expired deals, or outdated adapter formats.
- Keep affiliate, coupon, dropshipping, revenue, health, disability, financial, or legal claims under human review.
- Never publish deadnames, non-consensual identity data, or unapproved pronoun displays.

## Integration points

- **Obsidian/Claudian:** outputs saved as linked notes using `templates/release-sync-plan.md` and `templates/publish-gate-report.md`.
- **Claude Code:** load `.claude/skills/187publish/SKILL.md` directly.
- **CLI:** invoked via `187repo.sh publish` after Phase 6.
- **Adapters:** mirrored by `python scripts/generate-model-adapters.py`.

## Templates

| Template | When to use |
|---|---|
| [`templates/release-sync-plan.md`](templates/release-sync-plan.md) | Mapping every surface to its required update for a release. |
| [`templates/publish-gate-report.md`](templates/publish-gate-report.md) | Final go/no-go report with blockers and evidence. |
| [`templates/github-pages-launch-checklist.md`](templates/github-pages-launch-checklist.md) | Checklist for updating the GitHub Pages product showcase. |
| [`templates/adapter-sync-checklist.md`](templates/adapter-sync-checklist.md) | Verifying model adapters are regenerated and consistent. |

## Dashboards / UI representation

Future: `app/187publish/page.tsx` and Obsidian `_system/187PUBLISH Dashboard.md`.

## CLI exposure

Future: `187repo.sh publish`, `187publish.sh`.

## Docs route

`docs/187PUBLISH.md`

## Adapter regeneration

```bash
python scripts/generate-model-adapters.py
```

## Acceptance tests

1. Prompt: "187PUBLISH audit the suite for docs drift and showcase drift." → Expected: README coverage, AGENTS coverage, docs coverage, app route coverage, GitHub Pages coverage, adapter coverage, CI status, and release checklist.
2. Prompt: "Sync the release surfaces for the 187INCLUDE skill launch." → Expected: 187PUBLISH release sync plan listing README, AGENTS, docs, app, showcase, adapters, and install-doc updates.
3. Prompt: "Run the accessibility and inclusion publish checks." → Expected: 187PUBLISH confirmation that 187ACCESS+ and 187INCLUDE reviews are complete, with any blockers listed.
4. Prompt: "Prepare the GitHub Pages launch checklist." → Expected: 187PUBLISH GitHub Pages launch checklist with homepage copy, skill routes, screenshots, and SEO metadata.
