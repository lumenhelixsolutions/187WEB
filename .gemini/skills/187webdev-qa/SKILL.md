# 187WEBDEV — Pre-Ship QA

Run the full pre-ship audit before calling any page "done."

## Instructions

1. Read `../187webdesign/references/CHECKLIST.md` (or project-local `.grok/../187webdesign/references/CHECKLIST.md`).
2. Walk every section against the live page or PR diff. Map findings to the scoring lens: Design (40%) · Usability (30%) · Creativity (20%) · Content (10%).
3. Report blockers vs nice-to-haves. A blocker is anything that fails WCAG AA contrast, Core Web Vitals budget, mobile layout, or ships lorem/placeholder content.
4. Apply Chanel's rule on the final pass: remove one element that isn't earning its place.

For holistic design direction, also load `../187webdesign/SKILL.md`. For engineering issues, load `../187webdev-code-review/SKILL.md`.
